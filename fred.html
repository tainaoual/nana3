                         Baking Company to take a concept, Donut Maker Clicker, from the drawing board to the browser.
                          Fred the Baker is tired of making real donuts and is ready to retire.
                           He needs our help to keep his love of donuts alive. He wants you to create a game that uses button clicks 
                           to create virtual donuts for the world to enjoy. But all those early mornings of donutmaking may
                            have tired out his brain because he has some strange requirements for 'Auto Clickers' and 'Donut Multipliers'. Unfortunately, it's always
                         "Time to make the Donuts" and Fred is too busy to give us guidance on how to implement these requirements. </li>
